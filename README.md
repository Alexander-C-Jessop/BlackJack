# Blackjack Python Project

## Project Description

This project is a command-line implementation of the popular card game Blackjack. It allows users to play the game against a computer dealer. The goal of the game is to get a hand with a total value as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it.

The project demonstrates the use of fundamental Python concepts such as functions, loops, conditionals, and lists. It also showcases the ability to handle user input, generate random numbers, and create and manipulate data structures.
